                                    It's inevitable that youtube will have to start to deal with competitors.Bad for
                                    them. Good for the creators.
                                    But what is the Facebook creator studio monetization eligibility?
                                    What are the requirements? Are their requirements?
                                    Yes just like how youtube has it's monetization requirements
                                    facebook does aswell.

                                    <h2>Facebook monetization requirements.</h2>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>1. Your facebook page needs to be atleast 30 days old and have enough online
                                            presence,engagement to qualify for monetization. MIND YOU! Even if you do
                                            have a 30 day old facebook page your most likely not going to be eligible
                                            anyway like stated before if there isn't enough information or activity in
                                            the page. </li>

                                        <li>2. Your page needs a minimum of 10,000 followers. </li>
                                        <li>3. In the last 60 days of your facebook page you need, atleast "30,000
                                            one-minute views" on videos that are 3 minutes long. They could've just said
                                            30,000 minutes of watch time on videos that are 3 minutes long. Now MIND
                                            YOU!!! 30,000 minutes converted to hours is 500 hours.Compare that to
                                            youtube's 4000 hours.That is 3500 hours less watchtime, so alot less work
                                            for you. But it has to be done in a matter of 60 days. So start pumping out
                                            those quality videos out right now!!!. </li>


                                        <li>4. You must comply with facebook's "Partner Monetization Policies" which can

                                            youtube that are looped?) this includes gifs. Aggresive language is not

                                    <h2>The fastest way to be eligible?</h2>
                                    <p>Their is no shortcut here but... if you already have youtube videos you can start
                                        uploading those on facebook. Just keep pumping out videos like you do for
                                        youtube but be mindful of facebook's Partner Monetization Policies So if you
                                        have a youtube channel just about politics it's time to turn that dial around to
                                        a niche or a hobby. Video games will probably the easiest one here. Which is
                                        more advertiser friendly.Remember that you need to get 500 hours of watch time
                                        in a matter of 60 days.</p>
                                    <h2>Facebook also adds new monetization methods</h2>
                                    <p>Facebook also other monetization options for creators. They include paid
                                        groups,ad placement options, and packs of stars that their audience can send
                                        creators during livestreaming. They are also adding a the equivalent of twitchs
                                        "sub button" where a viewer can tip for $5 dollars a month to recieve unique
                                        content from the creator. </p>
                                    <p>To make the navigation of the website more easier for creators, Facebook has
                                        updated the creator studio fully. </p>
                                        <img src="../images/blog-images/inside-blog/creator-studio-page.png" alt="screenshot of facebook's creator studio dashboard">
                                    <p>So far in my opinion they done a very good job compared to youtube's creator
                                        page. Which has been in "beta" for an year now. Facebook has followed the
                                        principles UX design quite well if I do say so myself.</p>
                                    <p> Facebook's creator studio dashboard has a left menu for creator's to keep track
                                        of page and their video analytics,a monetization section that shows earnings
                                        from Facebook,Instagram and IGTV. Creators can also choose where to place ads in
                                        their videos. Which isn't a option I have seen in Youtube or anywhere before.
                                        From a creator standpoint this is a complete win because now viewers don’t have
                                        to be forced to watch interruptive ads in the middle of videos (which can lower
                                        watch time and make the user click away to another video) creator's can decide
                                        if the ads will be pre-rolled,image-based or a shorter video.</p>
                                    <h2>How much cut does facebook take?</h2>
                                    <p>Facebook takes 45% ad revenue from creators who place ad breaks in their videos.</p> 
                                        
                                    <p>
                                    For the other monetization options it isn't 
                                        clear yet, but it’s safe to assume there will be a revenue share. It's too early to
                                        get any actual percentage in, though Facebook has taken a 30 percent cut from game
                                        developers in the past, and currently takes a 45 percent share of ad revenue
                                        from people who place ad breaks in their videos, so it can be around 30 percent.
                                    </p>
                                    <h2>Will I be par taking in this? </h2>
                                    <p>I got really demotivated with youtube not monetizing my website and my videos aren't that advertiser friendly now that I look back on it.
                                    But the 500 hour watch time seems really attractive. 
                                    So I might come up with something in the future. </p>
                                    <p>Like many others I am trying to find another creator centered network that monetizes videos.</p>
